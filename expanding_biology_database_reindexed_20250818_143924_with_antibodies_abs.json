This approach allows for the use of standard antibodies and fluorescent proteins, unlike previous ExM methods that required custom synthesis of gel-anchorable labels. The proExM method achieves ~70 nm resolution, comparable to super-resolution techniques, but with the simplicity and accessibility of conventional microscopy. This work expands the applicability of ExM to a broader range of biological samples and imaging setups.",

Unlike traditional antibody-based methods, FLARE offers rapid, uniform labeling without the need for genetic manipulation, overcoming challenges like poor penetration in thick tissues and inconsistent reproducibility. The approach leverages well-known chemical reactions for labeling abundant reactive groups, providing a versatile toolset that complements molecule-specific probes. This work expands the utility of expansion microscopy by integrating it with FLARE, achieving improved spatial resolution and revealing detailed physiological structures across a range of tissues.",

Fig 2 shows optimization of fixation conditions to maintain cytoplasmic integrity, highlighting the importance of buffer choice. Fig 3 illustrates robust expansion across different cell types, including primary immune cells, with well-preserved nuclear and cytoplasmic structures. Fig 4 and 5 explore the preservation of nanoscopic structures like the NPC, showing that U-ExM can resolve subunit arrangements with high precision. Fig 6 applies U-ExM to visualize HIV-1 capsid interactions with the nuclear pore and within the nucleus, revealing distinct stages of the viral replication cycle.",
    "application_goal": "The protocol enabled visualization of HIV-1 post-entry events at super-resolution, allowing for the identification and characterization of viral cores interacting with nuclear structures. This approach provides insights into the spatial organization of viral components and their interactions with host cell machinery, which are critical for understanding the HIV-1 replication cycle.",
    "novelty": "This study demonstrates the application of U-ExM in virology, particularly for HIV-1 research, by enabling the visualization of viral-host interactions at a resolution previously unattainable with conventional fluorescence microscopy. The use of U-ExM combined with Airyscan microscopy bridges the gap between light and electron microscopy, offering a more accessible alternative to technically challenging super-resolution methods like STED or SMLM. The study also highlights the potential of U-ExM to unmask epitopes, allowing for simultaneous detection of viral and host proteins, which is a significant advancement over traditional immunofluorescence techniques.",

The use of U-ExM in this context allows for the visualization of complex structures like kDNA and basal bodies, which were previously only accessible through electron microscopy. The study also highlights the potential of U-ExM to bridge the gap between light and electron microscopy, offering a more accessible high-resolution imaging technique without the need for specialized equipment. This work builds on previous ExM variants by demonstrating its applicability to protozoan parasites and expanding the range of biological questions that can be addressed with this technique.",

This advancement offers a cost-effective and accessible method for nanoscale characterization, potentially accelerating the clinical translation of polymeric nanocarriers.",

By combining pre-gel labeling for both biomolecules, dual-ExM achieves high retention of signals and resolution beyond the diffraction limit without requiring specialized chemicals. This method provides a significant advantage over traditional super-resolution techniques, which struggle with thick tissue imaging due to light scattering, and offers a straightforward approach to achieve sub-diffraction limit imaging in 3D.",

Fig 2 compares COX4-mitochondria labeling under different digestion conditions, showing that IHC-pre with proteinase K preserves fluorescence best. Fig 3 evaluates GOLGA5-Golgi labeling, confirming that IHC-pre with proteinase K is optimal for both Golgi and reporter labeling. Fig 4 presents a digestion time course, indicating that 8-hour digestion balances expansion and fluorescence retention. Fig 5 demonstrates minimal distortion and enhanced resolution of Golgi structures post-expansion.",

    "novelty": "This study optimizes a 4x proExM protocol for fixed brain tissue, achieving ~70 nm resolution without requiring super-resolution microscopy. Compared to prior ExM variants, this protocol balances fluorescence retention and expansion factor, using proteinase K digestion to enhance visualization of densely packed organelles. The work advances the field by providing a robust method for organelle imaging in complex tissues, addressing challenges of fluorescence loss and sample distortion.",

Fig 3 confirms that the StcE-enhanced protocol preserves protein signals in cysts, with expected localization patterns for GAP45 and GRA2. Fig 4 reveals that GRA2 is distributed as puncta across the CST1-positive layer, providing new insights into its localization within the cyst wall.",

By incorporating an enzymatic digestion step with StcE mucinase, the study achieved full expansion of cysts, facilitating detailed investigations of cyst wall components and their spatial organization.",
    "novelty": "This study introduces an enzymatic enhancement to the U-ExM protocol, specifically targeting the glycosylated mucin domains of CST1 with StcE mucinase. This approach resolves the challenge of incomplete expansion in T. gondii cysts, a limitation of previous ExM variants. The enhanced protocol allows for nanoscale resolution of protein localization within the cyst wall, providing insights that were previously unattainable with standard super-resolution methods. This advancement is particularly significant for studying the chronic stage of Toxoplasma infection, where precise protein localization is crucial for understanding cyst formation and potential vulnerabilities.",

    "novelty": "This study introduces TT-ExM, a novel expansion microscopy protocol that combines trypsin digestion and tyramide signal amplification to address the challenges of protein loss and signal dilution in traditional ExM. Compared to previous ExM variants, TT-ExM offers improved signal retention and resolution without the need for sophisticated microscopy equipment. The use of trypsin, which has fewer cleavage sites than proteinase K, enhances fluorophore retention, while tyramide amplification boosts fluorescence intensity. This approach is particularly advantageous for visualizing lipid-rich structures, which were previously difficult to image due to detergent treatments in other ExM protocols.",

Unlike previous methods, exTEM provides high antibody compatibility for synaptic proteins and allows for precise localization of synaptic CAMs without genetic labeling. This approach bridges the gap between super-resolution fluorescence imaging and TEM, offering a powerful tool for studying protein-specific localization at nanometer scales.",

Fig 4: TEMI was used to image proteins and N-glycans, revealing distinctive distributions. Fig 5: TEMI revealed metabolic heterogeneity in mouse tumors, segmenting tissue into more regions than unexpanded samples. Fig 6: TEMI was applied to mouse kidney and pancreas, mapping lipid distribution.",
    "application_goal": "The protocol enabled high-resolution spatial mapping of diverse biomolecules, including lipids, metabolites, peptides, and N-glycans, in various tissues. This method allows for the profiling of biomolecular heterogeneity and structural organization in tissues, advancing spatial multi-omics profiling in biological and medical research.",
    "novelty": "This study introduces TEMI, a tissue-expansion method compatible with mass-spectrometry imaging, achieving single-cell spatial resolution without harsh denaturation treatments. Unlike previous methods that used high temperature or proteolysis, TEMI preserves biomolecules in their native state, enhancing spatial resolution and chemical sensitivity. The iterative expansion strategy allows for higher expansion factors, revealing detailed biomolecular distributions. TEMI's compatibility with standard MSI processing and its ability to map a wide range of biomolecules, including proteins and N-glycans, distinguishes it from prior ExM variants and super-resolution methods.",

Fig 2A shows the expansion capacity of cell-embedded hydrogels as a function of crosslinker concentration, while Fig 2B demonstrates the resolving power improvement with decreasing MBAA concentration. Fig 3 reveals detailed microtubule structures post-expansion, achieving a resolution of B50 nm. Fig 4 displays the clear resolution of clathrin-coated pits in post-expansion images, which were not visible pre-expansion.",
    "application_goal": "The protocol enabled the enhancement of expansion microscopy's resolving power by adjusting the crosslinker concentration, achieving a lateral resolution of B50 nm with a common confocal microscope. This improvement allows for detailed visualization of cellular structures such as microtubules and clathrin-coated pits, which are otherwise challenging to resolve.",
    "novelty": "This study introduces a systematic approach to improving the resolving ability of expansion microscopy by varying the concentration of the crosslinker MBAA. Unlike previous ExM methods that achieved a maximum expansion factor of B4.5x, this approach achieves a 5.7x expansion factor, resulting in a lateral resolution of B50 nm. This method provides a simpler alternative to more complex super-resolution techniques like STED and SMLM, which require sophisticated hardware and software. The study extends the hydrogel selection for ExM, potentially facilitating its combination with traditional super-resolution microscopy technologies.",

The use of lysostaphin, in combination with lysozyme and proteinase K, was crucial for achieving isotropic expansion. This work extends the applicability of ExM to Gram-positive bacteria, which have been difficult to expand due to their robust cell walls, and provides a method to study bacterial interactions with host cells at high resolution using standard microscopy equipment.",

Fig 10 and 11 further analyze image resolution and distortion in thermopositive RevExM, confirming effective resolution enhancement.",
    "application_goal": "The protocol enabled reversible control of the expansion factor, allowing for rapid wide-field imaging at a deswelled state and high-resolution imaging at an expanded state. This flexibility facilitates detailed visualization of subcellular structures and rapid observation of overall biospecimen shapes, overcoming limitations of traditional optical microscopy.",
    "novelty": "This study introduces a novel approach to expansion microscopy by incorporating thermoresponsive hydrogels, allowing reversible control of expansion factors through temperature changes. Unlike previous ExM methods focused on maximal expansion, T-RevExM offers adjustable expansion, providing both wide-field and high-resolution imaging in a single sample. The use of LCST and UCST hydrogels represents a significant advancement, enabling temperature-dependent reversible expansion without compromising image quality or introducing significant distortion. This method enhances imaging flexibility and resolution, offering a practical solution for detailed biological investigations.",

This approach facilitates the relocation of regions of interest in expanded samples, allowing for accurate quantification of expansion without the need for fluorescent labeling.",
    "novelty": "This study introduces the use of renal glomeruli as landmarks in expansion microscopy, providing a robust method for measuring expansion factors and distortion. Unlike previous methods that rely heavily on fluorescent labeling, this approach allows for accurate measurements using bright field microscopy. The use of glomeruli, which are easily identifiable and expandable, offers a significant advantage in iterative expansion protocols, enabling high-resolution imaging with minimal distortion. This method stands out by simplifying the process of locating and imaging the same regions before and after expansion, a task that is often challenging with traditional ExM techniques.",

Fig 2 compares pre- and post-expansion images of honeybee brain structures, demonstrating the linear increase in tissue size and resolution gain. Fig 3 presents a distortion analysis of Kenyon cell nuclei, confirming the isometric expansion of tissue. Fig 4 shows pre- and post-expansion comparison of projection neuron boutons, revealing increased spatial resolution of synapsin and BRP immunostaining. Fig 5 provides 3D reconstructions of projection neuron boutons, highlighting age-related differences in BRP cluster numbers. Fig 6 quantifies BRP clusters in nurse and forager bees, indicating synaptic plasticity. Fig 7 examines GABAergic innervation in mushroom body calyces, showing distinct arrangements with synapsin-positive boutons. Fig 8 combines neuronal tracings with antibody labeling, offering detailed insights into pre- and postsynaptic architecture of microglomeruli.",
    "application_goal": "The protocol enabled high-resolution visualization and quantification of synaptic structures in honeybee brains, allowing for detailed analysis of age- and experience-related synaptic plasticity in social insects. By overcoming the diffraction limit of conventional microscopy, the study provided new insights into the microarchitecture of synaptic circuits, particularly in the mushroom body calyces, which are crucial for sensory integration and memory formation.",
    "novelty": "This study is the first to apply expansion microscopy in a social insect species, specifically the honeybee, achieving expansion factors up to 4.5x. The work advances the field by combining ExM with immunohistochemical and neuronal tracing techniques, enabling visualization of synaptic structures at a subdiffraction scale. Compared to previous methods, this approach offers improved resolution and the ability to co-label presynaptic and postsynaptic elements, providing a more comprehensive understanding of synaptic plasticity. The use of Acryloyl-X SE (AcX) for anchoring represents a significant development, facilitating the retention of conventional antibodies and fluorescent proteins in the expanded matrix.",

Unlike conventional expansion microscopy, which digests biological matter for isotropic expansion, this method maintains microbial integrity while expanding the extracellular space.

The use of bioorthogonal click chemistry for labeling, combined with ExM, allows for \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m-level resolution, surpassing traditional super-resolution techniques like STED and SMLM. The study also highlights the compatibility of specific fluorophores with the ExM process, addressing challenges in fluorophore stability during gel polymerization.",

    "novelty": "This work advances the field by integrating expansion microscopy with spatial transcriptomics, offering enhanced resolution and RNA detection compared to traditional methods. Unlike previous ExM variants, this approach allows for subcellular resolution in spatial transcriptomics, overcoming limitations of optical crowding and enabling more genes to be interrogated simultaneously. The novel application of ExM to methods like MERFISH and VISIUM significantly improves their spatial resolution, making it possible to study complex tissues with greater detail and accuracy. This integration represents a significant step forward in the ability to map gene expression in situ, providing a powerful tool for biological and medical research.",

The study emphasizes the protocol's ability to visualize host-pathogen interactions, providing insights into the Plasmodium liver stage development.",
    "application_goal": "The protocol enabled the visualization of intracellular Plasmodium parasites during liver stage development, allowing for the study of host-pathogen interactions, such as lysosome association with the parasitophorous vacuole membrane. This approach provides a deeper understanding of the Plasmodium liver stage, which is crucial for developing anti-malaria interventions.",
    "novelty": "This study introduces a pre-gelation staining expansion microscopy (PS-ExM) protocol that adapts the ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) for pre-stained samples. Compared to traditional U-ExM, PS-ExM reduces incubation times and better preserves epitopes, allowing for simultaneous non-expanded controls. This method is particularly advantageous for studying host-pathogen interactions in the Plasmodium liver stage, offering a faster and potentially more epitope-preserving alternative to existing ExM protocols.",

    "novelty": "This study introduces cryo-ExM for visualizing cyanobacterial thylakoid membranes, achieving a 5.5-fold expansion that allows resolution of structures down to 60 nm. Unlike previous methods, cryo-ExM does not require cell wall-degrading enzymes and provides a homogeneous distribution of photosystems, contrasting with reports of microdomains in other studies. The method's ability to maintain cell shape and enhance immunolabeling intensity marks a significant advancement over traditional ExM and super-resolution techniques.",
