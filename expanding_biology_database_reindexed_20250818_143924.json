    "novelty": "This study introduces protein retention expansion microscopy (proExM), which anchors proteins directly to the swellable gel using a commercially available cross-linker, AcX. This approach allows for the use of standard antibodies and fluorescent proteins, unlike previous ExM methods that required custom synthesis of gel-anchorable labels. The proExM method achieves ~70 nm resolution, comparable to super-resolution techniques, but with the simplicity and accessibility of conventional microscopy. This work expands the applicability of ExM to a broader range of biological samples and imaging setups.",

Fig 6: Demonstrates manual tracing of axons using umExM, showing high accuracy compared to GFP signals. Fig 7: Explores higher resolution imaging by combining umExM with SACD and iterative expansion, achieving ~35 nm resolution.",
    "application_goal": "The protocol enabled dense and continuous labeling of membranes in fixed tissues, allowing for nanoscale visualization of membranous structures such as axons and dendrites. This facilitates the segmentation and tracing of neuronal processes, supporting detailed anatomical studies in neuroscience.",
    "novelty": "This study introduces umExM, which achieves dense membrane labeling with high signal-to-background ratio, enabling ~60 nm resolution imaging on a confocal microscope. Compared to previous ExM methods, umExM offers improved uniformity and continuity of membrane labeling, supporting detailed visualization of neuronal processes. The iterative expansion strategy further enhances resolution to ~35 nm, approaching electron microscopy levels, and allows for the co-visualization of proteins and RNAs, expanding the utility of ExM in biological research.",
