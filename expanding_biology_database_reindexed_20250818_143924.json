Fig 4: Visualization of cellular membranes in Jurkat T cells and Caco-2 cells using mCLING, demonstrating the ability to resolve fine ultrastructural details. Fig 5: Combination of TREx with antibody and NHS ester staining to provide subcellular context in U2OS cells.",
    "application_goal": "The TREx protocol enables high-resolution imaging of cellular and tissue ultrastructure by achieving a 10-fold expansion in a single step, allowing for detailed visualization of subcellular components such as proteins and membranes in both thick tissue sections and cultured cells.",
    "novelty": "TREx represents a significant advancement over previous ExM methods by achieving a 10-fold expansion factor without compromising gel integrity or requiring complex procedures. Unlike iterative ExM, which involves multiple rounds of expansion, TREx simplifies the process while maintaining compatibility with standard laboratory equipment. The method's robustness and ease of use make it accessible for a wide range of biological applications, providing enhanced resolution and isotropy compared to traditional 4x ExM and other super-resolution techniques.",
